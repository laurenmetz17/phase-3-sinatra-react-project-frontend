# Shoe Store Inventory Application

## Overview
This webpage allows you to view and create shoe inventory for shoe stores. On the stores tab you can view all shoe inventory as well as a count or filter by the store. On the create tab you can use the form to submit new shoes or stores which will appear on your inventory page. If the price of a shoe changes that can be updated in the input below the shoe, or the shoe can be deleted entirely. The inventory count will reflect the total shoes in the database for all stores or the count from an individual store you select.

## Usage 
1. Using the navigation bar at the top of the page you can click on the create tab to input a new store or a new shoe.
2. Input the details about the shoe or store. For store it takes name and address as text input, for shoe it takes name, style, price, and color as text inputs then you select which store it belongs to from a drop down menu. 
3. Submit the form and navigate to the stores tab to see the updated list of inventory and inventory count
4. Filter the inventory on the page by selecting the store you want to see from the drop down at the top or view all inventory by selecting all.
5. Update the price of an individual shoe by typing in the new price (numbers only) to the input below the shoe and pressing the change price button
6. Delete a shoe by pressing the X button below the shoe
